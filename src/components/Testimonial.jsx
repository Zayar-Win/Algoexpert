                                AlgoExpert was the backbone of my technical coding interview preparation. It allows you to efficiently work through the most common variations of problems asked by top-tier companies without having to spend hours 'battling' an algorithm only to come up with an inefficient or incorrect solution. There are a lot of resources available for repetition, but AlgoExpert differentiates its product by providing the 'how' and 'why' in clear and concise videos. Developing a deeper understanding of how to approach these problems is better than trying to memorize lines of code. I highly recommend AlgoExpert.

                                As a scientist who was looking to break into Tech, I knew the underlying logic of programming, but I had a lot of gaps in my understanding, especially on the types of algorithms questions asked at interviews. I can confidently say that AlgoExpert is one of the best resources out there for interview preparation, with fantastic video tutorials and an excellent question selection that allows you to get a deep understanding of the topics and confidence in your problem solving ability. The site is incredibly intuitive to use and I think that the staff are some of the best out there, being incredibly supportive and passionate about offering a great customer experience. I cannot recommend AlgoExpert highly enough.

                                I just accepted an offer with Palantir, and also received an offer from Amazon and a handful of startups. AlgoExpert does a great job selecting problems- many of my interview questions were variants of problems on the website. And when I came across problems I hadn't seen before, AlgoExpert gave me the tools to select the right data structures and identify patterns. Thanks AlgoExpert!

                                I'm just writing to thank you for this product. I had failed in so many interviews before, but I wanted to get into a top tech company so much that I even enrolled in a Master's program. Even then, I was unsure if I had what it takes to make it. From the moment I heard your first video explanation, I thought 'this is exactly the way to solve an interview question' (plus the extra points you can grab by asking clarifying questions). After a few months of studying, mainly on AlgoExpert, I got offers to intern at Microsoft and Google!

                                I just got a job offer from Oracle and most of the questions they asked, I had practiced on AlgoExpert. Even when they asked questions I was not familiar with, I was able to break down the problem and write code which I learned from the explanations section on AlgoExpert. Being a Computer Science Engineering student, I had fundamental knowledge in Data Structures & Algorithms, but I didn't know how to approach, break down and apply this knowledge to solve problems. Also since all the problems are classified into categories, I was able to easily identify my weak points and work on those. Extremely grateful to AlgoExpert !
